#Submission for Assignment 1
##For Dr. Khatri's ECEN 449-200 Class, Spring 2015
##From Yinwei Zhang

I apologize for the lateness, I let deadlines pile up over the weekend... well anyway, here it is.

I *didn't* get question 2 part 1 done or question 4 to fully work... my structural verilog seems a bit weak.  I can't get the initial statements to stabilize so that the output isn't XX.

Thank you,
Yinwei (Charlie) Zhang
